# Features

### Smart Built-in Tools
Chat WebUI comes with a range of built-in tools that can be used to perform various tasks, such as:

1. Online web search
2. YouTube video summarization
3. arXiv paper and abstract summarization
4. Webpage text extraction


To use these tools, simply add `@s` to the start of your query. For example:
```

@s latest premier league news

```
The tool will automatically call the right function based on the link you provide. For example, this will extract the website text:
```

@s Summarize this page https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot

```

### YouTube Summarizer
You can include a YouTube URL in your query to obtain a summary of the video. For example:


```

@s what is this video about? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4x8boB2KdI

```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/704e2f19-ee01-4b43-a314-eae8c3df04cb)
The order of your query and URL does not matter, for example this will work too:


```

@s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4x8boB2KdI what is this video about?

```
Alternatively, you can simply provide the URL to utilize the built-in prompt:
```

@s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4x8boB2KdI

```
This will employ the built-in prompt to generate a concise summary of the video.

### arXiv Paper/Abstract Summarizer
Include an arXiv URL in your query to receive a brief summary of the paper or abstract:
```

@s explain this paper to me https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762

```
Abstract URLs are also supported:
```

@s simply explain this abstract https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762

```

You can also paste the link to utilize the built-in prompt:

```

@s https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762

```
This will employ the built-in prompt to generate a concise summary of the paper or abstract.

### Webpage Scraper
If the link is not a YouTube or arXiv URL, the application will attempt to extract the text from the webpage:
```

@s summarize this into key points https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot

```
This also has built-in prompt that you can use by simply pasting the url:
```

@s https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot

```

### Online Web Search
If you do not include a URL in your query, the application will perform a web search using the built-in prompt:
```

@s latest released movies

```
For optimal results, format your query in a manner similar to a Google search. You can find the reference URL used in the command prompt window.

### Deep Query
Deep Query function has been changed in v1.1. Now pressing it will send thinking tag to the backend to force the model to think. For example the `</think>` tag.
You can set specific start tag and end tag for thinking models in additional settings.
This should ensure future compatibility for various reasoning model in the future.
Make sure to set your start tag and end tag in additional settings before using reasoning model.

There are 4 buttons here. 'Precise' will set your temperature to 0, 'Balanced' will set it to 0.5, and 'Creative' will set it to 1. Alternatively, you can use the 'Custom' option to manually set your sampler settings by separating them with commas. For example:
```

temperature=1, min_p=0.05

```

### Quirks
You can drag and drop image and text document to the chat window. RAG currently not supported so text document will use the full text as a context.
