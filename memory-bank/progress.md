# Progress

## What Works

- Basic file structure for memory bank is initialized.
- `project-brief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` files are created with initial content.
- Memory bank documentation is now complete.
- Core service layer basic files (Dockerfiles, app.py, requirements.txt) for knowledge-service and video-service are created.
- Core service layer Docker Compose file is updated to include knowledge-service and video-service.
- Implemented core logic for knowledge-service (ingest and query endpoints).
- Implemented core logic for video-service (video processing and YouTube upload endpoints).
- API Gateway is updated to proxy requests to knowledge-service and video-service.
- Active context documentation updated to track current feature implementation.
- Integration of Chat WebUI and YouTube SEO Generator is complete.
- YouTube SEO Generator has been refactored into a Flask service.
- Redis caching has been set up in the Chat Service.
- Reorganized the service folders (api-gateway, chat-service, knowledge-service, seo-service, video-service) to improve clarity and separation of concerns.
- Linting and auto-fix setup complete (flake8, black, isort, pre-commit).
- Created `docs` folder in the root directory.
- Created `docs/scripts.md` file to document useful scripts and commands.
- Created `docs/readme.md` file to provide project setup and usage instructions.

## What's Left to Build
- restructure each service folder with _init_.py files and best practises
- continue editing test files starting with api gateway
- Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
- Implement CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.
- (Future) Develop Knowledge Service and Video Service advanced features.

## Current Status

- A/B Testing for SEO Content is implemented.
- Advanced SEO Analytics Dashboard is implemented.
- Test files for api-gateway service created, but tests are not passing due to import error.

## Known Issues
- Pre-commit hooks are installed but not yet tested on actual code changes.
- YouTube credentials environment variable needs to be set for video-service to function correctly.
